# Overview
Step into the mindset of a hacker and uncover how web application vulnerabilities are identified through web protocols and session behaviors. In this hands-on lab, you'll learn to recognize and exploit critical security weaknesses commonly targeted by attackers. Through a few interactive exercises and a deliberately vulnerable web application, you'll explore real-world attack scenarios and practical demonstrations. This lab will walk you through the process of exploiting these flaws while also teaching you how to defend against them. By the end, not only will you understand how these vulnerabilities are leveraged, you'll understand how to apply secure development practices to build more resilient web applications.

## Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this lab, you will be able to:

- Understand 3 of the Top 10 OWASP web application vulnerabilities 
    - SQL Injection 
    - Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
        - DOM-Based 
        - Reflected
        - Stored
    - Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Exploit basic real-world like vulnerabilities in a controlled environment
- Learn how to mitigate these attacks through best practices

## Scenarios
In this lab, you will step into the role of both an ethical hacker and a defender as you explore attacking common web application vulnerabilities in a controlled environment. You will be guided through tasks and steps where you will learn how attackers exploit SQL injection to bypass login forms and extract user data, inject malicious JavaScript via Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and perform Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks to trick users into making unintended changes. Each attack is paired with practical defense strategies, equipping you to identify, exploit, and fix these common web application flows

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of HTTP and HTML
- Familiarity with web browsers and developer tools
- Basic programming knowledge in HTML, Python

## Lab Requirements
- Visual Studio Code (Text Editor)
- Python
- Git

## Disclaimer
This lab is designed to enhance your understanding of common web applications vulnerabilities and improve your cybersecurity skills to better protect your web applications. It may serve as a supplementary resource to help prepare for certifications such as Cisco's Ethical Hacker Certification.

All vulnerability exploitations should be performed in a controlled environment. Unauthorized use of these techniques demonstrated in this lab on systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test is prohibited and may be illegal.
