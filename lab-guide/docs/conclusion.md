# Summary 
In this lab, you explored the foundational concepts and practical techniques behind common web application vulnerabilities. Using a Python-based vulnerable web application with a backend database, you gained hands-on experience in identifying, exploiting, and mitigating 3 of the Top 10 OWASP vulnerabilities in SQL Injection, DOM-Based XSS, Stored XSS, Reflected XSS, and CSRF. 

Through guided steps, you discovered:

- How SQL Injections can be used to manipulate database queries to bypass logins and extract sensitive information. You also learned how parameterized queries serve as effective defenses. 
- The dangers of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in its various forms (Reflected, Stored, and DOM-Based). You gained insight how malicious scripts can be used to hijack user sessions and manipulate the webpage.
- How attackers can exploit user trust to perform unauthorized actions and how CSRF tokens can neutralize such threats.

This lab emphasized a defensive mindset, reinforcing the understanding how attacks works first. This experience lays a strong foundation for aspiring ethical hackers, developers, and security professionals. 

Security practices and mitigation strategies are continually evolving, as new attack vectors emerge daily. Continue building on these foundational techniques to contribute to a safer and more secure digital world
